# Changelog

## 0.6.0 (2026-07-14)

### Changed (breaking)

- **`/wayfinder` command removed; fog state is now derived from the active skill.** Running `/skill:wayfinder` turns fog ON, `/skill:implement` turns it OFF, and other skills (or non-skill messages) leave fog unchanged — so fog stays on across the whole wayfinder phase until the implement phase begins. This eliminates the cross-extension toggle problem (another extension like `pi-web-sync` can't dispatch `/wayfinder` via `sendUserMessage` because pi disables command dispatch for extension-sent messages — see `docs/adr/0002-fog-mode-toggle-seam.md`). Detection uses pi's own exported `parseSkillBlock` on the finalized user message (`message_start` event), and the `context` event back-computes fog state on session resume/fork.

### Added

- **`/fog on|off|auto` manual override** — escape hatch that pins fog to the given value until the next `/fog` call (skill transitions are ignored while pinned). `/fog auto` clears the pin so skill transitions drive fog again. Replaces the mid-phase toggle that `/wayfinder off` used to provide.

## 0.5.0 (2026-07-14)

### Changed

- **`/review` renamed to `/code-review`** — renamed `prompts/review.md` → `prompts/code-review.md` so the command matches the `/code-review` step referenced by the [mattpocock implement skill](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/implement/SKILL.md). The previous `/review` command no longer exists. (breaking)

## 0.4.1 (2026-07-14)

### Fixed

- **Fog-mode toggle** — `/wayfinder off` now actively removes the fog note from the system prompt instead of leaving it in the model's visible context. The note is wrapped in delimiters so `before_agent_start` can strip and re-inject it deterministically.

### Added

- **Invisible entry/exit reminders** — `/wayfinder` transitions now emit hidden custom messages (`wayfinder-guard:reminder`) that tell the model when fog mode turns on or off. This resolves cases where the model continued to behave verbally as if wayfinder was still active after toggling off.

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-13)

Four-axis parallel code review — added dedicated **Security** and **Optimization** reviewers.

### Added

- **`security-reviewer` agent** — reviews the diff for security vulnerabilities and production hazards, assuming a hostile world.
- **`optimization-reviewer` agent** — reviews the diff for optimization issues, scaled to 100x and checked for silent errors.

### Changed

- **`/review` prompt** — upgraded from two-axis (Standards + Spec) to **four-axis** (Standards, Spec + Traceability, Security, Optimization). Reports now come back under `## Standards`, `## Spec`, `## Security`, and `## Optimization`; the spec-reviewer also traces every entry point's call chain for seam breaks and round-trip proof.

## 0.3.0 (2026-07-13)

Simplification — the extension is now **`pi-wayfinder-guard`** (renamed from `pi-matt-pocock-skills`).

### Added

- **Fog mode** (`/wayfinder`) — enforces no implementation during wayfinder. A denylist with reasons blocks source edits, config/manifest changes, git mutations, dependency installs, and bash-based file mutation (`sed -i`, output redirects, `cp`/`mv`/`tee`/`dd`) while fog mode is on; read-only exploration, writing notes/`.md`, and running tests/builds stay allowed. Backed by a `tool_call` block plus a proactive `before_agent_start` system-prompt note.

### Removed (breaking)

- **All 12 skills** — users manage and update skills themselves.
- **3 agents** — `scout`, `planner`, `implementer` (sequential/single use). Only the parallel two-axis reviewers remain.
- **3 chain prompts** — `scout-plan-chain`, `implement-chain`, `implement-review-chain`. Replaced by a single parallel `/review` prompt.
- **`setup-matt-pocock-skills`** and its generated repo docs (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/`).
- `NOTICE`, `UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md`, `scripts/check.mjs`, `HANDOFF.md` — all skill-derived or obsolete.

### Changed

- Package renamed `pi-matt-pocock-skills` → `pi-wayfinder-guard`.
- `prompts/review.md` — parallel two-axis review (Standards + Spec) against the current diff.

## 0.2.1 (2026-07-12)

Default-entry fix + cohesion polish — the extension now owns its own `/grill-with-docs`.

### Added

- **`grill-with-docs` skill** (12th skill) — the documented default entry to the v1.1 lifecycle, restored verbatim from `mattpocock/skills` @ `d574778`. Without it, sessions fell back to a foreign copy and the README lifecycle diverged from the video narrative.
- **`scripts/check.mjs`** — static sanity checks (`npm run check`): SKILL.md frontmatter parses, companion refs resolve, skill-count consistent across README/NOTICE/tree, every file ships via `npm pack`. Catches the regressions that previously bit this repo.

### Changed

- **README lifecycle** — `/grill-with-docs` is now the default entry (was bare `/grilling`). The diagram, skill table, and supporting-skills section updated; `/grilling` reframed as the core primitive both `/grill-with-docs` and wayfinder's grilling tickets build on. `/domain-modeling` is now documented as captured automatically by `/grill-with-docs`.
- **`ensureAgentsInstalled()`** — now warns when bundled agents are already present (previously silently skipped, leaving no trail when a stale customization shadowed a bundled agent). Fires on partial installs too.
- **NOTICE / UPSTREAM-CHANGES** — account for the 12th skill (Batch 3 delta record).

## 0.2.0 (2026-07-12)

Cohesion audit — the extension is now a coherent, honest derivative of `mattpocock/skills` @ `d574778`.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Prompt renames** to a consistent `-chain` suffix: `/implement-and-review` → `/implement-review-chain`, `/scout-and-plan` → `/scout-plan-chain`, `/implement` (prompt) → `/implement-chain`. Rule: `/foo` is a skill, `/foo-chain` is a sub-agent-delegating prompt.
- **`/code-review` is a skill only** — the colliding prompt is removed; the skill now uses the dedicated `standards-reviewer` + `spec-reviewer` agents (was `general-purpose`).
- **`/implement-review-chain` now runs the full two-axis review** (parallel `standards-reviewer` + `spec-reviewer`), not a generic reviewer pass.
- **Generic `reviewer` agent removed** (6 → 5 agents); nothing invoked it after the chain upgrade.

### Added

- **11 skill companion files** restored verbatim (issue-tracker templates, triage-labels, domain, CONTEXT/ADR formats, prototype LOGIC/UI, tdd tests/mocking) — now shipped via `npm pack`.
- **README `## Workflow` section** — lifecycle diagram, supporting skills, prompt chains, HITL↔AFK ranking.
- **`UPSTREAM-CHANGES.md` Batch 2** — records every post-derivation delta.

### Fixed

- Rephrased 7 `disable-model-invocation` slash-references to address the user, not the model (`implement`, `to-tickets`, `wayfinder`).
- `NOTICE` now lists all derived companion files.

## 0.1.0 (2026-07-10)
